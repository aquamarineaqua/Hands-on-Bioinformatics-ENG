## Chapter 1 RNA-Seq Data Processing and Analysis: Alignment, Quality Control, and Quantification

This chapter covers RNA-Seq data processing and analysis, including alignment, quality control, and quantification. The content is adapted from STAT 115 2021 Homework 1.

The original course used the human genome as the study subject and executed the analysis pipeline on a server. However, ordinary computers are generally not powerful enough to handle human genome computations. For educational purposes and to enable analyses such as `STAR` to run efficiently on a standard laptop, I have selected a yeast genome (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) as the study model.

Before proceeding with practical implementation, it is recommended to first review the theoretical concepts from the original course.
