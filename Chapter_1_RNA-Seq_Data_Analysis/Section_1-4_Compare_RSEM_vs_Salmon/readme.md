**Chapter 1** RNA-Seq Data Processing and Analysis: Alignment, Quality Control, and Quantification

**Section 1-4** Compare RSEM vs Salmon

Adapted from *STAT 115 2021 Homework 1 Problem 6*

---

We have completed RNA-Seq quantification using two different algorithms: `RSEM` and `Salmon`. In the previous section, we compared their computation speeds, where Salmon (**3** seconds) was significantly faster than RSEM (**32** seconds).

In this section, we compare the differences in quantification results between the two methods. Our analysis focuses on the following key metrics: **effective length**, **normalized read counts**, **TPM**, and **FPKM**, to evaluate the differences in their quantification outputs.
