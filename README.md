**A hands-on bioinformatics learning tutorial**

### Main Content:

- **Environment setup**
- **Prerequisite knowledge explanation**
- **Lab and Homework implementation from the Harvard Stat 115/215 course**

I have incorporated my own understanding and modifications, and reproduced the analyses using **Python and R**. All analyses in this tutorial can be executed on an ordinary laptop (no server needed).

Each tutorial is organized as a **directory**, with `readme.md` as the main documentation. Most tutorials are accompanied by an **equivalent Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)**.

Examples in this tutorial are implemented in both **Python and R**, so no prior Python knowledge is required.
